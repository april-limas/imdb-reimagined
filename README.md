# IMBD Reimagined

A social media application for movie lovers inspired by the IMDB app. A user can browse the website without creating an account and see basic movie details. By creating an account, a user can customize personal movie watchlists and access movie reviews by website users. 

# What I Learned

- Built a web application using Django
- Implemented class-based views, simple forms and model forms
- Utilized two backend APIs to retrieve movie information
    1. The Movie Database API (TMDb)
    2. The Open Movie Database API (OMDb)
- Used a .env file to store the django secret key and API keys
- Implemented network requests to have sufficient exception handling for 4xx and 5xx responses
